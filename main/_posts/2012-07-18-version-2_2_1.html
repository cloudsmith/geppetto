<h2>In this release</h2>
<ul>
<li> Recognition of hiera functions is now included in all puppet targets.
</li>
<li> Project specific preference flags are now stored in the project itself instead of in the workspace metadata.
     If you have used project specific settings you may need to re-enable them after the update.
     The good news is that project specific settings can be checked in and takes effect automatically when importing
     the project into a new workspace/instance of Geppetto. Project specific preferences now also behaves as
     expected (platform bugs had surprising results regarding what was actually saved).
</li>
<li> Malfunction in Auto Save Actions could destroy content (this was released as a hot-fix).
</li>
<li> The fictional 2.8 target is now replaced with a 3.0.0 target based on the puppet 3.0.0 release candidate 3.
     If you had 2.8 selected as a target, you will automatically get the new 3.0 target.
</li>
<li> General stability fixes, and fixes of spelling/wording errors.
</ul>
